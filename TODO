Ok, the big one I see that needs fixing is storage_object.data() (and the commented out data_stream()) method.  You're probably already working on this, but the user needs a way to pass a ruby 'block' to the method that can read from the stream in chunks.  Take a look at the AWS gem; they've got some great examples in there.

The same applies to object.write().  The data argument should support either an in-memory string, block, or byte-stream.

TESTS: Great work, looks like a comprehensive set of test coverage! Can I ask that you also throw in some tests for UTF8 container/object names too?
